### About

resorts located across the Rocky Mountain region.  Using a pre-made / scraped
list of resorts.  crawler.py navigates through the website and obtains snow,
temp and dates for each resort.    

The crawler utilizes useragent spoofing, rotating proxies, and a random delay
between each request to simulate users and minimize impact on the target website.  


## Features 
API - for tying IOT devices  
WebApp - practice building / storing data  
Snow Analyzer - fun / curiosity  

## requirements
